## Abstract

<p class="message-highlight">Personalized Depression Treatment Ontology</p>

The Personalized Depression Treatment Ontology aims to enhance the personalization of treatment plans for individuals diagnosed with depression by integrating diverse data sources, including genetic profiles, demographic information, and clinical outcomes. This ontology serves as a decision-support tool for clinicians, enabling them to access patient-specific recommendations that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of mental health care. By mapping relationships between patient demographics, genetic markers, and therapeutic options, the ontology will hopefully reduce the traditional trial-and-error approach, providing evidence-based treatment paths that account for individual variability in treatment response. Key features include the integration of clinical trial data, genetic studies, and real-world patient-reported outcomes to continuously refine recommendations. This ontology addresses critical needs in the mental health field, providing stakeholders such as clinicians, researchers, and genetic counselors with a robust framework for delivering tailored treatment strategies that enhance patient outcomes and reduce treatment resistance.
