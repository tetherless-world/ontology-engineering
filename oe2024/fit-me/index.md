<p class="message-highlight">Add a representative diagram of your project such as the below workflow diagram illustrating the flow between the components.</p>

Our knowledge representation approach backed by our study cohort ontology and the knowledge graphs instantiating Table 1 data, are built to support analytical applications to determine applicability of a study population to a patient. Our [data sources](./papers-used.html) include cited research studies from the pharmacologic and cardiovascular complications chapters of the ADA Standards of Medical Care guidelines, and patient records selected from the NHANES 2015-2016 questionnaire. Our population analysis scenarios are designed to determine if studies match, if there are limitations and to evaluate their quality. Additionally, we visualize similarity of a group of study subjects (arm) to a patient.
