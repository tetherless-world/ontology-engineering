## Maintenenance Policy

Our maintainance policy is primarily focused on ensuring that our data remains available for use as long as possible. The ontology will not be updated for the forseeable future once version 1.0 work is done. Any new changes will be documented through the website's versions.

## Getting Involved

There is no future work planned as of now. If work is done in the future, then there is much room for expansion. The core of the ontology can be worked on to fix up the actual exercise plans. In addition, the food part of the ontology was cut out for the sake of time. This can be expanded quite a bit and the previous versions of the ontology contain food entities.
