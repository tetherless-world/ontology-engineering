		<rdfs:label>LCC Language Representation Ontology</rdfs:label>
		<dct:abstract>This ontology, based on ISO 639 as well as the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), provides a systemic description of the vocabulary used for language representation, including natural and artificial languages.

ISO 639 provides two language codes, one as a two-letter code (ISO 639-1) and another as a three-letter code (ISO 639-2, ISO 639-3, ISO 639-5) for the representation of names of languages. ISO 639-1 was devised primarily for use in terminology, lexicography, and linguistics. ISO 639-2 represents all of the languages contained in ISO 639-1 and additional languages and language groups, as they may be coded for special purposes when more specificity is needed. The languages listed in ISO 639-1 are a subset of the languages listed in ISO 639-2; every language code element in the two-letter code has a corresponding language code element in the three-letter code, but not necessarily vice versa. ISO 639-4 provides the basis for describing languages, as defined in this ontology, and additional codes are provided in 639-5 and other parts of the standard with more details about macrolanguages, other lesser known independent languages, and special language groups.

ISO 639-3 extends the set of three-letter codes provided in 639-2 to cover all of the natural, human languages in use today, along with many well-known ancient, extinct, and historical languages, including written and signed languages. It also identifies the codes found in 639-2 that represent families or groups of languages rather than a single human language, depending on the perspective of the consumer.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-1 is the International Information Centre for Terminology, ISO 639-1/RA. This organization is responsible for maintenance of Part-1, and more information can be found at http://www.infoterm.info/standardization/iso_639_1_2002.php, although the actual code set is maintained by the US Library of Congress, together with the code set for ISO 639-2.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-2 is the Library of Congress, ISO 639-2/RA. The Library of Congress is responsible for maintenance of Part-2, at https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/iso639-2ra.html. Current code sets for ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 are available from this site, as mentioned above. In addition to the material covered in the basic standard, the Library of Congress also publishes the German names for all languages, which is reflected in the properties given below. See https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langhome.html for the latest release.

The Registration Authority for ISO 639-3 is SIL International, ISO 639-3/RA. SIL International is responsible for maintenance of Part-3, and more information can be found at https://iso639-3.sil.org/about.

The codes included herein also correspond to the language element of the Language Tag specified in BCP 47 (RFC 4646, RFC 4647), and can be used for matching or other application development purposes (e.g., use of language identifier literals in applications that build up the RFC 4646 based tags).

This ontology (Language Representation) defines the model for the standard, based in part on ISO 639-4, with individual codes for the other parts of the standard represented in dependent models.</dct:abstract>

		<skos:historyNote>This ontology is ultimately intended to represent all of ISO 639 for reference purposes, and to be sufficiently extensible to accommodate new clauses or modifications as they are published. The current version of the ontology (including subordinate modules containing the language names and codes) provides a unique English name (i.e., the reference name from 639-3) for each language, with UTF-8 encoded literals specifying alternates in English, French, and Indigenous languages where present in the standard, and in German corresponding to the names on the LoC web site.

1. Where multiple English names occur in 639-1 and 639-2, we have used the primary name specified in 639-2:1998 superseded by the latest revision posted by the registration authority, or, where multiples are specified by the registration authority, the reference name from ISO 639-3 as the &apos;named individual name&apos; for a given language. For languages specified in ISO 639-1, there is at least one English name and at least one French name for every language, corresponding to exactly one alpha-2 code. Most languages from ISO 639-1 have at least one indigenous name. Most languages with codes available from the Library of Congress also have at least one German name. The correspondence between the alpha-2 codes and languages are made explicit in the individuals representing the codes themselves, and can be inferred for the languages using an OWL DL reasoner.

2. This release of the ontology covers all languages specified in parts 1 and 2 of the standard, and categorizes the alpha-3 codes from part 2 according to the categorization scheme provided in parts 3 and 4. Subsequent releases of the ontology will address additional languages covered in part 3, as well as additional components of the standard, such as equivalence to standards representing relevant scripts, as they become available, and the language groups covered by ISO 639-5.

3. We have used individuals to represent all alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, which, in turn, have matching strings (tags) associated with them for use in a variety of applications to facilitate reasoning and mapping. The strings are provided as datatype properties of the individuals to support applications that may require them for RFC 4646-style tagging.
 
4. Note that some tools, including certain UML tools, are case insensitive. Thus, in cases where a language name collides with an alpha-2 or alpha-3 code, (i.e., Ga, Ewe, Fon, Ido, Lao, Tiv, Twi, Vai, and Yao), the names for the individual codes have been extended with &apos;_1&apos; (e.g., &apos;ewe_1&apos;).

5. We found a few anomalies in the standards while developing this ontology. These include: 
(1) Bihari is included in the 2002 version of 639-1, in the 1998 version of 639-2, and in the online codes posted by the Library of Congress in 2007 for parts 1 and 2, with part 1 code of &apos;bh&apos; and part 2 bibliographic and terminology codes of &apos;bih&apos;. At that time, there was no discussion stating that Bihari is a collective language, although it was omitted from the downloadable data for 639-3. Since then, the language element has been renamed &apos;Bihari languages&apos;, in both English and French, without change to the corresponding language codes. The latest version of the code sets reflect this modification. Our assumption is that the trigraph for Bihari is a collective language code, which is supported by online research in Eastern Indic languages.
(2) Serbo-Croatian was included in the 2002 version of 639-1, with part 1 code &apos;sh&apos;. It was not mentioned in the 1998 version of 693-2, but appears in 639-3 with a language identifier of &apos;hbs&apos;, without codes for 639-2. As of 2010, Serbo-Croation has been eliminated from ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes altogether, and the ontology reflects this.
(3) Other changes in the latest version of the ontology include elimination of the 639-1 code for Moldavian, merging the language with Romanian, and additional English and French names for some languages, such as Dutch (to include Flemish, flamais), among others.
(4) German names for languages in ISO 639-2 were added to the Library of Congress in 2014, and are supported in this version of the ontology.

6. The LCC 1.0 version of this ontology, published in advance of the 2017 New Orleans OMG Technical Meeting, was current as of 31 July 2017 with respect to the ISO 639-1 and 639-2 codes included herein.</skos:historyNote>
