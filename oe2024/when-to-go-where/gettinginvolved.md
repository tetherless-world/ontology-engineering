## Maintenenance Policy

The When To Go Where Ontology was created by the When To Go Where team in the Ontology Engineering Course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute during the 2024 fall semester. As of Fall 2024, the team has concluded active development and maintenance of the ontology. To ensure that the ontology remains accurate and up-to-date, we encourage community contributions. Whether you're suggesting enhancements, reporting issues, or submitting pull requests, your input is invaluable. All contributions undergo a thorough review process to maintain quality and compatibility before being integrated into the main ontology. For any maintenance-related inquiries or support, please open an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tetherless-world/ontology-engineering/tree/when-to-go-where). While the original team is no longer actively maintaining the ontology, ongoing community involvement is essential for its continued improvement and relevance.
