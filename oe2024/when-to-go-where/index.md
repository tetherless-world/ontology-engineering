## When to Go Where

When to go where is a project that aims to promote outdoor exploration across the 63 National Parks in the United States. We would like to give people a tool that will allow them to find national parks that will fit any preferences that they may have. We want to give people as few excuses as possible for not pursing outdoor activities such as camping and hiking.

To achieve this we are creating a semantically enabled application that will leverage an OWL ontology to answer user questions. Our interface will give users options to input preferences and using semantics we will identify the best parks that match a users particular criteria.
