### General Model [(Full Size)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetherless-world/ontology-engineering/movie-recommender/oe2020/movie-recommender/images/conceptualModel.png) [(Editable Version)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MSmUmnXD892Ia6nD116NB8nuCs-uXFc1/view?usp=sharing):

The above model shows how most of the high level classes connect to each other in the Movie Recommender ontology. It shows the basic construction of a creative work, the various classes connected to it that serve as attributes, and how it breaks into movies and TV shows. The contributor class is also detailed in this general model.

### Genre Model [(Full Size)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tetherless-world/ontology-engineering/movie-recommender/oe2020/movie-recommender/images/genresConceptualModel.jpg) [(Editable Version)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SaZrs4M5MLkLHHiZZzHqiqZpFmZ0tR-z/view?usp=sharing):

The above model shows how the concept of a genre is represented in the ontology, and how there are several aspects to what classifies a movie, such as the production type and style rather than just a single word designating what the movie "is".
