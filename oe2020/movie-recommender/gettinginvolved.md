## Maintenance Policy

Our maintenance policy is focused on keeping our ontology public, free to use, and easy to access. Updates to the ontology will first be reflected in the movie-recommender branch of the Github repository, accessible [here](https://github.com/tetherless-world/ontology-engineering/tree/movie-recommender/oe2020/movie-recommender). This website will also be updated alongside the repository, and changes to the ontology (as well as all past versions) will be available in "Concept Map & Ontology" side tab.

## Getting Involved

There are many areas in which the Movie Recommender ontology can be improved, ranging from additions to the class structure to improvements to the queries to population of the ontology data. If you are interested in contributing to the Movie Recommender ontology, feel free to contact the following individuals:
* Justin Chen (chenj37@rpi.edu)
* Liam Haining (hainil@rpi.edu)
* Dhruv Patel (pateld7@rpi.edu)
