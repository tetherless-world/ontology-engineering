        <h2>Maintenenance Policy</h2>
        <p>Overview of policy goes here, an example is below</p><br />
        <p>Our maintainance policy is primarily focused on ensuring that our data remains available for use as long as
            possible. We will never change the name of our ontology or its URL. This will ensure that references to our
            ontology will always be valid and that we will not break applications that may come to rely on our ontology
            in the future. Any future changes to the ontology will be appropriately documented both in the headers of
            the ontology itself and in accompanying documentation. Future versions of the ontology with “breaking
            changes” will be hosted at new URLs so that previous versions of the ontology continue to be available.

        <h2>Getting Involved</h2>
        <p class="message-highlight">Please mention plans for future work here and enlist the emails of team members</p>
        <br />
        <p>There are several places where the project could expand. Different types of expansion include encoding
            measurement information, adding other common types of allergies and dietary restrictions, expanding the food
            classification, adding recipes and ingredients, and improving the inference of substitutions.
