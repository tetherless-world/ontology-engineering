## Abstract
The application of  semantic web techniques to create intelligent systems in different domains is an  active area of research in both academia and industry. In this work, we attempt to support an intelligent system in the clinical domain  to better assist the health needs and concerns of the diabetic populations. There exist several guidelines and evidence-based sources of information for people facing a chronic disease such as type-2 diabetes to read and review. However, the amount of information contained can be difficult to review for non-experts and additionally patients might  seek to be informed about the evidence behind the recommendations. Our system can be used  to make such information gathering and sorting a far easier process for every party involved as well as provide any helpful information to the users of the system related to their query. To create our system, we developed an ontology model to bring together the information of the patient and the associated clinical guidelines that can be used to aid them. This model lends itself to drawing better inferences on patient data as well as provides the ability to query information on patient data and on the guidelines they match. Furthermore, to evaluate our ontology, we designed competency questions keeping in mind the questions that users would want assistance with when dealing with medical guidelines. We demonstrate that our model was able to address these questions with answers that would enable users in their food and lifestyle decision-making.
