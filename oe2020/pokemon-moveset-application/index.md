## Abstract
As games become increasingly complicated, professional gamers and their audience are faced with a growing amount of information they need to understand and navigate to intelligently participate and compete.  In most cases, players simply memorize these facts and navigate them by intuition and trial-and-error, resulting in potentially large time costs to answer questions about new styles of play.  A technique for efficiently encoding the multiple layers of complexity and available information is absent; such a tool could greatly improve the accessibility of complex games for both veteran and novice players. Ontologies encode, relate, and can reason on abstract information (which can be changing, versioned, and distributed); as such, they fit these requirements perfectly.  Here, we demonstrate this on the Pokémon franchise: it has a healthy esports community, and there is a particular problem involving relatively simple mechanics that is greatly complicated by the scale of the game: teaching a specific Pokémon a specific move.  Although our technique can answer a number sub-questions players may find useful, this specific task requires players to memorize, minimally, hundreds of unique Pokémon, hundreds of unique moves, which Pokémon can learn which moves, and then navigate this information in its entirety to find a solution.

## Project Overview Diagram
This section will provide an overview on how an application leveraging Pokemon Moveset Ontology would provide solution to the user. 
The diagram below describes the architecture of the application.  The system in the current work is limited greatly in scope from the below.  A working framework for the ontology has been deployed and tested; however, it only handles a few Pokémon, Moves, and Items - sufficient to demonstrate all the core functionality. The user interface, system backend, and connection with external databases was cut from the project scope.
