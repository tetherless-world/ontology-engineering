## Maintenenance Policy
The Pokemon Movset Ontology was created in Pokemon Moveset Project in Ontology Engineering Course at RPI during Fall 2020.
- Any person who desires to work more in depth with and contribute to this ontology can do so by notifying any of the current team members. 
- Any and all changes will be documented and updated on the website in order to show the accurate representation of the project. All prior version should be properly archived in Github.   
- Upon any major changes to the ontology, a new version should be created and the previous version should be archived properly. These changes shall be reflected in the query, usecase, termlist and conceptual model if nessasary.

## Getting Involved
The Pokemon Moveset Ontology can be expanded in multiple dimensions. With many different generations of Pokemon games and more mechanics to model, we believe that our ontology can be expaned to provide support for more players.
