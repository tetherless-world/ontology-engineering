## Maintenenance Policy

The beer-ontology was created in the Beer-Advisor project for the Ontology Engineering course of RPI (Rensselaer Polytchnic Institute) during Fall 2020. The code therefore was developed by the students that were part of the project and it is maintained as part of the Tetherless World legacy repository for the Ontology Engineering course from past semesters. The authors do not aim to perform modifications in the main ontology URL after the final version is delivered. However, notifications will be posted if such modifications occur. More information about the ontology URI, past versions URI and update notes can be found in <a href="https://beer-advisor--rpi-ontology-engineering.netlify.app/oe2020/beer-advisor/ontology#ontologies">ontology section</a> and in the ontology header. 

## Getting Involved

The Beer-Advisor project can be expanded to represent all types of beers and to represent more relevant beer properties. If you are interested in contributing to the Beer-Advisor project or have any other ideas or suggestions, please contact the authors using one of the emails below:
