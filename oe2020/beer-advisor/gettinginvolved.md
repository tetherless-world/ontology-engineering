## Maintenenance Policy

The beer-ontology was created in the Beer-Advisor project for the Ontology Engineering course of RPI (Rensselaer Polytchnic Institute) during Fall 2020. Upon delivery of the final version the ontology will remain at the same URL. Any and all changes will be documented and updated in the website. More information about the ontology URI, past versions URI and update notes can be found in <a href="../beer-advisor/ontology#ontologies">ontology section</a> and in the ontology header. 

## Getting Involved

There are many different ways in which the Beer-Advisor project can be expanded. With the ever-growing amount of beer styles and a multitude of properties, there are many different expansions possible. If you are interested in contributing to the ontology, please contact us at the following emails:
