## Maintenenance Policy

The beer-ontology was created in the Beer-Advisor project for the Ontology Engineering course of RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) during Fall 2020.
<ul>
<li>Upon delivery of the final version the ontology will remain at the same URL.</li>
<li>Any and all changes will be documented and updated in the website in order to keep the ontology up to date.</li>
<li>Upon any major change to the ontology, a new version will be produced and the previous version will be archived. These changes will then be reflected inside of the use case, quieries, and conceptual models.</li>
</ul>
More information about the ontology URI, past versions URI and update notes can be found in <a href="../beer-advisor/ontology#ontologies">ontology section</a> and in the ontology header.
