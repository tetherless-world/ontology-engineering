The principal aim of the critique of various contemporary positions is to reinforce in students the importance of developing and critically maintaining their own values, vision, and voice in the design and making of architecture that was initiated in ARCH 2150, The Ethos of Architecture.

The course will also give students a deeper theoretical understanding of architectural acoustics in order to assist them in room acoustics research. There will also be labs to reflect typical measurement procedures and (if time permits) site visits to acoustics research labs and different types of acoustical spaces. The Sonics Research Lab II emphasizes more training on independent hands-on and problem-solving skills (than the SRL I).

In addition, researchers also leverage computing power to describe, model, and predict dynamic behaviors that could otherwise not be perceived in such large-scale omics data. Along with these topics, students will learn to critically read current scientific literature. A student cannot get credit for both this course and BIOL/BCBP 4660 and BCBP 6650." ;

To describe these choices the cause will introduce the concepts of opportunity cost, demand and supply theory, and market structures. It will consider the role of government in making resource allocation choices. Students will also study important macroeconomic data such as gross domestic product, economic growth rates, inflation, and unemployment. Additionally, studied will be the role of money and banking in the economy and short-run events such as recessions and expansions.

The course will also review the data and assess its suitability for modelling. Time series, Markov chain, optimal control, linear programming, statistical analysis, and other mathematical tools will be used to reveal the data's secrets. The bottom line is these insights will be used to make recommendations to firms and other decision makers.Students will also look at qualitative problems through the examination and discussions of cases in class. Not everything can be distilled to a number and so a holistic view of business problems will be taken to make more strategic recommendations. Teams of students will then solve and present these case results." ;

Students will work to develop critical thinking and advocacy skills. Professionals who work with environmental issues need to effectively argue for a position. Therefore, class participation plays a significant role in this course. Students should come to class prepared to discuss, debate, and (re)consider. Effectively advocating for one point of view requires an understanding of other perspectives. One must approach every issue with an open mind and a willingness to engage on a legal and policy level rather than from a personal or political perspective. This objective detachment is one of the hardest and most crucial skills students will work to learn. Over the course of the semester, the class will feature guest speakers (dates and identities TBA). Assigned readings for the guest speakers will replace those on the syllabus for that day. Depending on student progress and interests, the readings may change." ;

Students will be exposed to the theoretical frameworks that are used to examine how the law shapes society, and society shapes the law, and develop an understanding of the social processes that affect the legal system.

During the course, students will read and discuss articles and case studies in which the technical solution pursued did not have the desired effect, or led to disaster. Possible explanations include a failure to take into account the environmental, economic, socio-cultural, and/or political issues associated with the technology's ultimate usage." ;

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost." ;

Drawing as a means of understanding forms the basis for a semester-long project to be done in small groups.

The course approach will involve in-class presentations, project work, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning.

The structural makeup of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composite materials is discovered and their resulting properties, costs, and life cycle consequences are clarified. An understanding of basic mechanical properties is established hands on by conducting tension, compression, and 3-point bending tests (mse-lab). Physical performance of material constructs as synergy between form and material properties is further illustrated. Experiments are conducted that introduce such major concepts as structural loading, properties of sections, and resulting system performance. Sustainability: The concept of life cycles is introduced; material and energy flows are tracked throughout the entire material life cycle. This will be accomplished alongside introducing major material groupings (metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites). Students come to realize that environmental concerns are directly related to structural composition and material availability. Consequences of resource extraction, distribution, manipulation, use, and disposal, reuse or recycle are addressed at both local and global scales. Selected field trips to materials extraction, processing, manufacturing, disposal, and recycling facilities are aimed to give physical meaning to the concept of life cycle." ;

Innovative, non-normative structural systems are investigated and discussed. Analysis and design will proceed using primarily computer-aided techniques. The course approach will involve in-class presentations, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: The following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: structural robustness, and programmatic flexibility. (Design optimization approaches are introduced and explored as avenues to accomplish more optimum design conditions under increasingly strict design constraints.)" ;

The fundamentals of statics are presented in order to gain an understanding of the way in which external forces produce internal stresses in individual members and, in essence, flow through the building system to be resolved at the foundation level. The principles of strength of materials are studied to understand how particular structural materials and configurations manage to resist these forces without unacceptable distortions, or even failure. Wood structural properties are studied in all their complexity as a means to internalize the more theoretical topics broached. Through in-class presentations, reading, homework and project work, computer lab, field trips, and case studies, the student will be aided in developing this intuitive (while practical) understanding. It is recognized that intuitions of building technologies are not acquired quickly but result from much study, observation, and practice. Introduction to Structures makes use of the several approaches above to ensure that the beginning student is provided with a broad, solid base for future structural investigations. WebCT will be used to expand the student's access to course materials and allow for a measure of distance learning. Sustainability: the following notions are introduced as important attributes of sustainable structures and construction: durability and service life and life cycle cost.

A new and progressively more complex topic is introduced each week, and each topic is presented with an associated design exercise. This course is taught in a seminar format with some instructor led tutorials and workshop content linked to dedicated breakout time for completing assignments and modeling. A devoted archive folder for downloading and uploading course material and completed exercises will be used for the course. B.Arch. students can only register for the 4000 level of this course and M.Arch. students must register only for the 6000 level of this course." ;

The course will examine the ISO standards of room-acoustic measurements, develop students' research goals and a specific set of data to gather for their research. The course will also prepare the students with the fundamental knowledge on CATT Acoustic and/or EASE in geometrical modeling. Then the students and professors will visit a number of performance venues (e.g. EMPAC Concert Hall, and/ or other venues) and perform the room-acoustic measurements. Students will then work on analyzing and interpreting the research results. Practice measurements will be scheduled in the gallery or somewhere on campus before trips to performance halls. MATLAB will play a central role throughout all the classes (SRL I & II) and the thesis research projects. It will be used during the class exercises. Within one week from the semester start, every student is required to INSTALL a functioning MATLAB Software package onto her/his laptop computer.B.S. and B.

Similarly, the concept of a 'policy,' high-level guidelines providing a general course of action (or inaction) in a given area, is not new. Putting those two concepts together, however, is a recent phenomenon which has created a set of intriguing challenges. What is 'open data?' What does it mean to 'share' data? Who makes such policies and how are they implemented? Do data policies look the same all over the world? What are the economic, cultural, and technological implications/impacts of/on a given data policy? How would one even go about understanding and evaluating a data policy? This course takes the basics of policy design and analysis, blends in critical thinking skills, ethics, group dynamics, national perspectives, and international perspectives, and applies it all to the world of big data." ;

Projects are selected to provide interaction between nuclear engineering and engineering physics majors to provide exposure to cross-fertilization of ideas and team interaction, which simulates anticipated future professional experience. The product of each design project is a comprehensive report or design proposal having both global and detail completeness. Under some circumstances, the project may involve development of cost information necessary to effect construction and may actually involve construction and commissioning of the designed apparatus. This is a communication-intensive course.' ;
