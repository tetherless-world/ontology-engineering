## Maintenenance Policy

Any person who desires to work more in depth with and contribute to this ontology can do so by notifying any of the 
current team members. Additionally, any changes or updates to the ontology must be documented on the website in order 
to show an accurate representation of its current state and record provenance details of such changes. By using links
to Github commits and documents published from Google Docs, new and old versions of the ontology and its artifacts
are neatly available in one location.

## Getting Involved

Although the Course Recommender Ontology was created and designed for our specific use case, we believe it has great 
potential for expansion and implementation not only for Rensselaerâ€™s purposes but also for institutions across the
country. If you are interested in working on the Course Recommender Ontology, please contact one of the project
