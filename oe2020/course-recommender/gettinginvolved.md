## Maintenenance Policy
After the end of Ontology Engineering in the Fall 2020 semester, any person who desires to work more in depth with this ontology can do so by notifying any of the current team members. Additionally, any changes or updates to the ontology must be documented on the website in order to show an accurate representation of its current state and record provenance details of such changes. By using Github commits and documents published from Google Docs, new and old versions of the ontology and its artifacts are neatly available in one location. We will also add instructions to cite our ontology (and potential publications) on the website.

## Getting Involved
Although the Course Recommender Ontology was created and designed for the purposes of this class, it has great potential for expansion and implementation not only for Rensselaerâ€™s purposes but also for institutions across the country. If you are interested in working on the Course Recommender Ontology, please contact one of the project members by email below:
