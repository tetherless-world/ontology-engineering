## Maintenenance Policy

The Course Recommender Ontology was created during the Fall 2020 semester of Ontology Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

- After the end of the Fall 2020 semester, the final versions of the ontology and its artifacts will remain available
through the various links on this website.
- Periodic updates may be made to the content available on this website.
- Periodic updates may be made to the Individuals ontology to reflect updates in course offerings each semester.
- History and related files for this ontology and website can be viewed in the [Github repo](https://github.com/tetherless-world/ontology-engineering/).
- Future changes to the ontology and related artifacts will be documented on the website, and previous versions of
 any updated artifact will remain accessible after updated versions are released. 
- Anyone interested in contributing to this ontology may contact the current team members.

For more information about the ontology, please see our Design, Research, and Resources sections!

## Getting Involved

Although the Course Recommender Ontology was created and designed for our specific use case, we believe it has great 
potential for expansion and implementation not only for Rensselaerâ€™s purposes but also for institutions across the
country. If you are interested in working on the Course Recommender Ontology, please contact one of the project
