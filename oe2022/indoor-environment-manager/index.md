## Abstract

This project aims to develop an ontology that recommends a viable solution to improve IEQ for occupants and minimize energy use in an office. According to reports written by U.S. Energy Information Administration, heating, cooling, ventilation, and lighting account for 46.2% of the energy use in commercial and residential buildings. This energy is used for enhancing indoor environmental quality (IEQ). In a room, IEQ is affected by many factors: temperature, humidity, airflow, air quality, etc.; however, each building is under different environmental conditions including weather, outdoor air quality, direction/location of the building, etc. Additionally, every occupant has different a clothing level and metabolic rate. Potential solutions may be available; but, they have different influences on IEQ. In this project, we propose an ontology find an optimal solution to minimize energy use by combining several sets of knowledge: 1) thermal comfort based on temperature, humidity, air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing level, 2) occupancy behavior for IEQ, 3) indoor air quality, 4) interior illumination level.
